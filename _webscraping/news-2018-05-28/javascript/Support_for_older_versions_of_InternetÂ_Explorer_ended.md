Support for older versions of InternetÂ Explorer ended
======================================================

Beginning JanuaryÂ 12,Â 2016, only the most current version of InternetÂ Explorer available for a supported operating system will receive technical supports and security updates. InternetÂ ExplorerÂ 11 is the last version of InternetÂ Explorer, and will continue to receive security updates, compatibility fixes, and technical support on WindowsÂ 7, WindowsÂ 8.1, and WindowsÂ 10.

What does this mean?
--------------------

It means you should take action. After JanuaryÂ 12,Â 2016, Microsoft will no longer provide security updates or technical support for older versions of InternetÂ Explorer. Security updates patch vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malware, helping to keep users and their data safer. Regular security updates help protect computers from malicious attacks, so upgrading and staying current is important.
