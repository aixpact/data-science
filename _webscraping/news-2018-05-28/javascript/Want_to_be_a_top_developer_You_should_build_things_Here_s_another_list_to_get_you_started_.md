Want to be a top developer? You should build things. Here’s another list to get you started.
============================================================================================

Due to high demand I’m extending the list of fun apps to build. 😁

Here’s the initial post. Feel free to post your applications in the comments or on Twitter.

Everyone knows that skill is acquired by hard work mixed with passion. In order to become good at something, one must put in the effort.

Nothing good comes easy. If it’s hard, it’s worth doing. Most of us are excited to code, but frequently lack the ideas. Allow me to present some challenging, yet fun ideas to build.

Without further ado, let’s jump in!

### Project #1: GraphQL powered Node.js Backend

GraphQL has revolutionized the way we send and receive data. Absolutely worth your time to check it out.

#### Specifications:

I suggest this course to get you up and running.

### Project #2: Terminal app

A terminal application is simply an application that runs inside the terminal.

Try starting small, and create a simple app that runs in the terminal. The mechanics behind terminal apps are very simple: you give some input and get back the output (I/O)

#### Some really simple ideas to get started:

Here’s a great aggregated list of learning JavaScript terminal apps.

### Project #3: Electron desktop application

Electron lets you build native desktop applications with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some of the most well-known Electron apps are: Visual studio code, Atom, Slack, and Webtorrent.io

Once again, start small and build on top of that. For example, start your electron application, create an input, and display the output to your terminal. If you’re familiar with web development, Electron will be very conventional.

### Project #4: Instagram clone

Instagram is a convoluted application, and (re)building it will teach you a lot. Some of the highlights of what you will be learning by building Instagram are:

Feel free to use any technology as you see fit.

Instagram is kind enough to provide us with their API.

### Project #5: Data visualization with D3.js

D3 stands for Data-Driven-Documents. D3 is by far the most used library for charting. It’s not the only option, though — there are couple more like ChartJS and plotly.JS.

This one really gets me excited. Let’s visualize a dataset with D3.js. You can pick any dataset from the link below.

Awesome GitHub repository consisting of free-to-use public datasets.
